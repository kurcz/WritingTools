## üöÄ What is Writing Tools?

Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence-inspired application for MacOS that supercharges your writing with AI LLMs. It lets you fix up grammar and more with one hotkey press, system-wide. It's currently the world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant.

### üåü Why Choose Writing Tools?

Aside from being the only Windows program that works like Apple's Writing Tools:

- **Forked for MacOS**: Mofied the original to work on MacOS because only M-Series Macs will get Apple Intelligence.
- **Versatile AI LLM Support**: Jump in quickly with support for the **free Gemini API**, or use an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama *[instructions below]*, llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) with Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-Compatibility.
- **System-wide Functionality**: Works instantly in **any application** where you can select text. **Does not overwrite your clipboard**.
- **Completely free and Open-source**: No subscriptions, no hidden costs. Bloat-free & uses pretty much **0% of your CPU**.
- **Chat Mode**: Invoke Writing Tools with no text selected to enter a chat mode for quick queries and assistance.
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device & work without the internet.
- **Supports Many Languages**: Works for any language! It can even *translate* text across languages better than Google Translate (type *"translate to [language]"* in "Describe your change...").
- **Code Support**: Select code and ask Writing Tools to work on it (fix, improve, convert languages) through "Describe your change...".
- **Themes, Dark Mode, & Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.

Invoke Writing Tools with no text selected to enter a chat mode.

## üñ± How to Use

1. Select any text in any application (or don't select any text to use chat mode).
2. Press your hotkey (default: Control+Space).
3. Choose an option from the popup menu or enter a custom instruction.
4. Watch as your text is magically improved!

## üõ† Installation

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `Writing.Tools.zip` file.
   
2. Extract it where you want, run `Writing Tools.exe`, and enjoy! :D

   *Note: If you extract Writing Tools into a protected system folder like Program Files, you'll need to run it as administrator at least on the first launch or it won't be able to create/edit its config file (in the same folder as its exe).*
   
3. To let it automatically start when you boot your PC, add a shortcut of the `Writing Tools.exe` to the Windows Start-Up folder (Open Run and type `shell:startup` to get to this folder). 

## ü¶ô (optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose the LLM you want to use form [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: Llama 3.1 8B if you have ~8GB of RAM or VRAM.
3. Open your terminal, and type `ollama run llama3.1:8b`. This will download and run Llama 3.1. That's it! Leave this running in the background.
4. In Writing Tools, choose the `OpenAl Compatible` AI Provider, and set your API Key to `ollama`, your API Base URL to `http://localhost:11434/v1`, and your API Model to `llama3.1:8b`. Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection! üéâ

## üîí Privacy

I believe strongly in protecting your privacy. Writing Tools:
- Only sends text to the chosen AI provider (encrypted) when you *explicitly* use one of the options.
- Only stores your API key locally on your device.
- Does not collect or store any of your writing data by itself. It doesn't even collect general logs, so it's super light and privacy-friendly.

Note: Privacy policies may vary depending on the AI provider you choose. Please review the terms of service for your selected provider.

## üêû Known Issues
1. The initial launch of the `Writing Tools.exe` might take unusually long ‚Äî this seems to be because AV software extensively scans this new executable before letting it run. Once it launches into the background in RAM, it works instantly as usual.
   
2. On some devices, the text selection detection may act up.
   To fix it, simply restart Writing Tools.
   This is being investigated.

3. If you change the hotkey from the default, and an app already uses that hotkey, Writing Tools may not be able to intercept that hotkey from that app. Good alternative hotkeys include **ctrl+`** or **ctrl+j**.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To run Writing Tools directly from the code

If you prefer to run it directly from the `main.py` file:

1. Download the code by clicking this button above:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c6cab79-4918-451c-9ad1-1bbcf8472275)

2. Right-click the folder of the code you downloaded, and click Open in Terminal.
   You'll only have to do this once: Type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   Of course, you'll need to have [Python installed!](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Any time you want to run the program, just type `python main.py` in your terminal.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To compile the application yourself:

Here's how to compile it with PyInstaller:

1. Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. Run the build script: `pyinstaller-build-script.py`

Ideally, run this in a Python venv.

## üåü Contributors

Writing Tools would not be where it is today without its amazing contributors:

1. [Cameron Redmore (CameronRedmore)](https://github.com/CameronRedmore): Extensively refactored Writing Tools and added OpenAI Compatible API support, streamed responses, and the chat mode when no text is selected.

2. [Disneyhockey40 (Soszust40)](https://github.com/Disneyhockey40): Helped add dark mode, the plain theme, tray menu fixes, and UI improvements.
